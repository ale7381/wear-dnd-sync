This access can be granted in ADB. This is undocumented functionality and may not work on all devices. If you do not know how to use ADB - you should not make these changes. You can open https://github.com/rkkr/wear-dnd-sync/blob/master/README.md to copy command from browser or click command to copy to clipboard.</string>
